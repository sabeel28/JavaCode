break down of code step by step:

```java
public class Strings {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        // Reverse the string: "hello" -> "olleh"
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("hello");

        for(int i = 0; i < sb.length() / 2; i++){
            int front = i;
            int back = sb.length() - 1 - i;

            char frontChar = sb.charAt(front);
            char backChar = sb.charAt(back);

            sb.setCharAt(front, backChar);
            sb.setCharAt(back, frontChar);
        }

        System.out.println(sb);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **StringBuilder Initialization:**
   ```java
   StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("hello");
   ```
   - You initialize a `StringBuilder` object with the string "hello". 
`StringBuilder` is mutable, meaning you can modify its content without creating a new object.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```java
   for(int i = 0; i < sb.length() / 2; i++){
   ```
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < sb.length() / 2`. This means it only iterates over the first half of the string. 
The reason for this is that when reversing a string, you only need to swap the first half with the second half.

3. **Swapping Characters:**
   ```java
   int front = i;
   int back = sb.length() - 1 - i;
   ```
   - `front` is the index of the current character from the start of the string.
   - `back` is the index of the corresponding character from the end of the string.

   ```java
   char frontChar = sb.charAt(front);
   char backChar = sb.charAt(back);
   ```
   - `frontChar` stores the character at the `front` index.
   - `backChar` stores the character at the `back` index.

   ```java
   sb.setCharAt(front, backChar);
   sb.setCharAt(back, frontChar);
   ```
   - The `setCharAt` method is used to replace the character at a specific index in the `StringBuilder`.
   - You swap the characters at `front` and `back` indices.

4. **Output the Result:**
   ```java
   System.out.println(sb);
   ```
   - After the loop finishes, the `StringBuilder` contains the reversed string, which is then printed out.

### How It Works:

- **First Iteration:** 
  - `i = 0`, `front = 0`, `back = 4`.
  - Swap characters at indices `0` and `4` -> "oellh".

- **Second Iteration:** 
  - `i = 1`, `front = 1`, `back = 3`.
  - Swap characters at indices `1` and `3` -> "olleh".

- The loop stops because `i` becomes `2`, which is equal to `sb.length() / 2`. The string is now fully reversed.

### Summary:

Your code manually swaps characters from the start and end of the string, working towards the center, effectively reversing the string. 
This approach demonstrates how to reverse a string without using built-in methods, which is a useful exercise for understanding how string 
manipulation works at a lower level in Java.
